### Tic Tac Toe
-------------------

This is an implementation of the popular Tic Tac Toe game using Ruby and applying Test Driven Development.

The main task was to make it unbeatable so I placed the logic which instead of predicting outcomes it simply reacts to the opponent's move by countering any possible traps and setting them up as well if possible.

To play the game do the following:

Clone the repository:

`git clone git@github.com:Maikon/TicTacToe_Ruby.git`

Change into the directory:

`cd TicTacToe_Ruby`

To run it:

`ruby lib/run.rb`

Or if you are in the the `lib` directory simply type:

`./run.rb`

If the above fails to run due to permissions, do the following first:
`chmod a+x run.rb`
